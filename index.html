       <p id="tsandcs"><span>Henry would like to acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of the lands on which he works and lives, and recognise their continuing connection to land water and community. We pay our respects to Elders past and present. </span>Australia is a vast, mysterious, endlessly surprising country. But if there’s one thing Henry’s sure of, it’s that he stands on land belonging to the Gadigal People of the Eora Nation. You might not be in Australia right now, but Henry is, and like many people here he wants to pay tribute to those who were here first. <span>Paul, I think I told you. Henry's a writer not a fighter.</span> He may roll up in an LA Raiders bomber jacket from time to time, but don't be fooled: Henry is a peace-loving creative. Rather than starting passive-aggressive email battles with suits, Henry believes that politeness and judicious use of mind control can achieve anything. <!-- <span>Henry's creative partner is cereal.</span> At 13, Henry would get through 3 bowls of cereal a day. At 21, Henry would get through 3 bowls of cereal a day. But at 35, Henry has finally diversified, getting through an enormous bowl, and one coffee mug, of cereal a day. He doesn’t seem to put any weight on, the prevailing theory being that he metabolises Sultana Bran into ideas and awkward silences.  --><span>The future is only something that hasn't been done yet.</span> Some people fear doing the unfamiliar. But wiring up a vintage Coogi sweater to Spotify is hardly going to trigger the apocalypse. <span>Time is the most precious resource we have. </span>The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter will, given time, eventually write the complete works of Shakespeare. By that logic, they’ll also crack a Titanium Grand Prix-winning idea that costs $3.25 to make. Being a glorified monkey with a typewriter himself, Henry knows it’s time, not money, that’s the key. So he'll never complain about budget, but he will push to maximise the available time, and increase the chances of everyone making Shakespeare-level work. <span>Every job is an opportunity.</span> If not to make history, then to at least make an ad much better than it might otherwise be. <span>When you see the trick, you lose the magic.</span> There are times and briefs where the nut needs a sledgehammer to crack it. But there are times when the audience can hear what we’re saying without us ever saying it. It feels like magic. No (over)explanation needed. <span>Henry is not a former cast member of the Mickey Mouse Club</span> but he's generally what you'd call a positive guy, and insists on using his energy to find the upside rather than moan about the down. <!-- <span>Henry is a human insinkerator.</span> He does to the carcass what napalm does to trees: stripping it of everything that’s digestible, plus assorted internal bones and nubbly things. You should see him at yum cha. Please don’t challenge Henry to eat his own hand. <span>--><span>Sometimes, advertising has to get out of its own way.</span> Henry makes ads. Henry likes making ads. Some of his best ads are addy as hell. But sometimes, be it because the subject matter is serious and delicate, or because advertising gives the target audience ‘the ick’, Henry believes in parking the shtick (and the ick) and letting plain honesty carry the day. <span>‘Work in progress’ is genuinely work in progress.</span> Although creatives are accustomed to getting a helping hand from budgets and the leathery snap of a producer's whip, Henry is quite comfortable spurring himself on to get his own things done. Some personal projects are zooming, some are inching, but either way Henry makes hay like a turbocharged combine harvester to turn his pipe dreams into reality. <span>Great work is its own award.</span> Henry’s done a bunch of ads that have won awards. But it was purely by accident. Truth is, Henry doesn’t allow himself to be driven by the prospect of shiny gold statuettes. But he definitely cares about making great work that happens to win them. <span>‘Taste’ is a gross word.</span> To Henry’s ear it’s rigid, elitist, and makes you sound like a Hamptons grandmother talking about chintz. So rather than throw the T-word around and alienate people, Henry prefers to have a bigger conversation about things like tone, balance, authenticity, originality, self-awareness, humanity, and other things that ‘taste’ is frequently a lazy substitute for. That way, the work feels just right, and no one sounds like they’re debating the merits of watered silk napkins for their spring dinner party. <span>Dubai-based recruiters calling at 3am with a job at a 'leading below-the-line multinational', take note:</span> Being an insomniac, Henry will actually be up to answer the phone. Being an insomniac, he’ll be happy to chat. And chat. So by all means, keep calling Henry at 3am. You'll never get around to talking shop or putting him forward for a gig, but you will have a great 30 minute conversation that'll make at least one of you fall asleep. <span>The last time Henry even saw a pressure cooker was at his grandmother's house in 1993</span> which tells you how relevant they are to the ad agency work culture of 2024. 
While some CDs like to create an environment of fear and manufactured stress, Henry prefers to get results through collaboration, exploration, and the dangling of the carrot that is career-defining work.<span>"woah, tastes like meat glue"</span> said an American art director upon trying the murky Kiwi breakfast spread known as Marmite. Which Henry must have, in the fridge, at your workplace. You may not understand it. You probably don’t like it. But to paraphrase Everything But the Girl, without Marmite, Henry misses Marmite like the deserts miss the Marmite. (As for what it’s made of, the old US Military policy of ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ applies here.) <span>Please help Henry avoid a 9th career change.</span> Henry is a former artist, former postgrad classics scholar, former (and sometimes current) DJ, former radio jock, former producer, failed actor, thwarted concert pianist, failed opera singer, and a not as-yet failed creative director. After 17 ¾ years in advertising, Henry is still here, still loving it, and still channelling all his past lives to create interesting stuff. Given the only career change left for him is real estate, Henry is highly motivated to make amazing work just so he doesn't have to wear a polyester blazer on Saturdays.<span> Let's be real.</span> You only have to look at the prevalence of botox to know that authenticity doesn't come naturally for advertising. Although the essence of what he does is making stuff up, Henry believes in as often as possible casting real people, having them talk like real humans, in real locations, doing stuff for real, with real stuff. All of which (as far as Henry knows) helps create good work, and might, for all the CGI and forced smiles, help offset the ambient bullshit levels in the industry. <span> Henry is entitled to be a walking Rubik's cube.</span> Four days a week on average, Henry will wear a tasteful combination of black, white and muted patterns (microchecks, pinstripes, that sort of thing). But on that average fifth day, Henry reserves the right to appear in a getup that would put <a href="https://www.we-heart.com/2015/10/20/karl-lagerfelds-memphis-apartment/" target="blank">Karl Lagerfeld’s early ‘80s Monaco apartment</a>  to shame, and make even Erno Rubik turn (gyroscopically) in his grave.<span> Falling is not collapsing. Falling is extending.</span> This piece of language is the title of an <a href="https://www.fondation-entreprise-ricard.com/MAP-events/view/2326-Marwa-Arsanios-Falling-Is-Not-Collapsing-Falling-Is-Extending" target="blank">art work</a> by Lebanese-American video artist Marwa Arsanios. But to Henry, it seemed like a fresh alternative to "fail faster" - which after 265,342 mentions in agency manifestos has long since lost all meaning. The idea that "falling" is not a mistake, but a valuable opportunity to grow and learn, is something Henry really lives by. (Cutely, it also echoes Henry's general lack of coordination, and tendency to fall in the literal sense.) <span>The hippocratic oath isn't just for med school grads.</span> Don’t market soda to 7 year-olds = don’t be tokenistic = don’t bully juniors = don’t lie = don’t exploit a noble cause to win awards = don’t touch gambling clients = don’t steal the stationery = do no harm.<span> "Nothing exceeds like excess" - Michelle Pfeiffer, Scarface.</span> This is a core belief. Henry goes too far with (in no particular order) records, hats, Campari, scarves, old drum machines, New Balance 998s, movies starring David Patrick Kelly, synonyms, '70s Milanese design, '90s video game soundtracks, West Coast hip hop lyrics, breakfast, failed cults, stretching of metaphors, multiple Soundcloud podcasts open in one browser, and salt.

    hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix, angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night, who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz, who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated, who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkan-
    sas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war,
    who were expelled from the academies for crazy &amp; publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull,
    who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall, who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York, who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night with dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares, alcohol and cock and endless balls,
    incomparable blind streets of shuddering cloud and lightning in the mind leaping toward poles of Canada & Paterson, illuminating all the motionless world of Time between, Peyote solidities of halls, backyard green tree cemetery dawns, wine drunkenness over the rooftops, storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon blinking traffic light, sun and moon and tree vibrations in the roaring winter dusks of Brooklyn, ashcan rantings and kind king light of mind, who chained themselves to subways for the endless ride from Battery to holy
    Bronx on benzedrine until the noise of wheels and children brought them down shuddering mouth-wracked and battered bleak of brain all drained of brilliance in the drear light of Zoo, who sank all night in submarine light of Bickford's floated out and sat through the stale beer afternoon in desolate Fugazzi's, listening to the crack of doom on the hydrogen jukebox, who talked continuously seventy hours from park to pad to bar to Bellevue to museum to the Brooklyn Bridge, a lost battalion of platonic conversationalists jumping down the stoops off fire escapes off windowsills of Empire State out of the moon,
    yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts and memories and
    anecdotes and eyeball kicks and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars,
    whole intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days and nights with
    brilliant eyes, meat for the Synagogue cast on the pavement,
    who vanished into nowhere Zen New Jersey leaving a trail of ambiguous
    picture postcards of Atlantic City Hall,
    suffering Eastern sweats and Tangerian bone-grindings and migraines of
    China under junk-withdrawal in Newark's bleak furnished room,
    who wandered around and around at midnight in the railroad yard wonder-
    ing where to go, and went, leaving no broken hearts,
    who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars boxcars racketing through snow toward
    lonesome farms in grandfather night,
    who studied Plotinus Poe St. John of the Cross telepathy and bop kabbalah
    because the cosmos instinctively vibrated at their feet in Kansas,
    who loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary indian angels
    who were visionary indian angels,
    who thought they were only mad when Baltimore gleamed in supernatural 
    ecstasy,
    who jumped in limousines with the Chinaman of Oklahoma on the impulse 
    of winter midnight streetlight smalltown rain,
    who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or
    soup, and followed the brilliant Spaniard to converse about America
    and Eternity, a hopeless task, and so took ship to Africa,
    who disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving behind nothing but
    the shadow of dungarees and the lava and ash of poetry scattered in
    fireplace Chicago,
    who reappeared on the West Coast investigating the FBI in beards and shorts
    with big pacifist eyes sexy in their dark skin passing out incompre-
    hensible leaflets,
    who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze 
    of Capitalism,
    who distributed Supercommunist pamphlets in Union Square weeping and 
    undressing while the sirens of Los Alamos wailed them down, and
    wailed down Wall, and the Staten Island ferry also wailed,
    who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before 
    the machinery of other skeletons,
    who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in policecars for 
    committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty and 
    intoxication,
    who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof
    waving genitals and manuscripts,
    who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists, and
    screamed with joy,
    who blew and were blown by those human seraphim, the sailors, caresses of
    Atlantic and Caribbean love,
    who balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the grass of
    public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to whom-
    ever come who may,
    who hiccuped endlessly trying to giggle but wound up with a sob behind
    a partition in a Turkish Bath when the blond &amp; naked angel came to 
    pierce them with a sword,
    who lost their loveboys to the three old shrews of fate the one eyed shrew
    of the heterosexual dollar the one eyed shrew that winks out of the
    womb and the one eyed shrew that does nothing but sit on her ass
    and snip the intellectual golden threads of the craftsman's loom.
    who copulated ecstatic and insatiate with a bottle of beer a sweetheart a
    package of cigarettes a candle and fell off the bed, and continued
    along the floor and down the hall and ended fainting on the wall with
    a vision of ultimate cunt and come eluding the last gyzym of con-
    sciousness,
    who sweetened the snatches of a million girls trembling in the sunset, and
    were red eyed in the morning but prepared to sweeten the snatch of
    the sunrise, flashing buttocks under barns and naked in the lake,
    who went out whoring through Colorado in myriad stolen night-cars, N.C.,
    secret hero of these poems, cocksman and Adonis of Denver--joy to
    the memory of his innumerable lays of girls in empty lots &amp; diner
    backyards, moviehouses' rickety rows, on mountaintops in caves or
    with gaunt waitresses in familiar roadside lonely petticoat upliftings
    & especially secret gas-station solipsisms of johns, &amp; hometown alleys
    too,
    who faded out in vast sordid movies, were shifted in dreams, woke on a 
    sudden Manhattan, and picked themselves up out of basements hung-
    over with heartless Tokay and horrors of Third Avenue iron dreams
    & stumbled to unemployment offices,
    who walked all night with their shoes full of blood on the snowbank docks
    waiting for a door in the East River to open to a room full of steam-
    heat and opium,
    who created great suicidal dramas on the apartment cliff-banks of the Hud-
    son under the wartime blue floodlight of the moon &amp; their heads shall 
    be crowned with laurel in oblivion,
    who ate the lamb stew of the imagination or digested the crab at the muddy 
    bottom of the rivers of Bowery,
    who wept at the romance of the streets with their pushcarts full of onions
    and bad music,
    who sat in boxes breathing in the darkness under the bridge, and rose up to
    build harpsichords in their lofts,

    who coughed on the sixth floor of Harlem crowned with flame under the
    tubercular sky surrounded by orange crates of theology,
    who scribbled all night rocking and rolling over lofty incantations which in
    the yellow morning were stanzas of gibberish,
    who cooked rotten animals lung heart feet tail borsht &amp; tortillas dreaming
    of the pure vegetable kingdom,
    who plunged themselves under meat trucks looking for an egg,
    who threw their watches off the roof to cast their ballot for Eternity outside 
    of Time, &amp; alarm clocks fell on their heads every day for the next 
    decade,
    who cut their wrists three times successively unsuccessfully, gave up and
    were forced to open antique stores where they thought they were 
    growing old and cried,
    who were burned alive in their innocent flannel suits on Madison Avenue
    amid blasts of leaden verse &amp; the tanked-up clatter of the iron regi-
    ments of fashion &amp; the nitroglycerine shrieks of the fairies of advertis-
    ing &amp; the mustard gas of sinister intelligent editors, or were run down
    by the drunken taxicabs of Absolute Reality,
    who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge this actually happened and walked 
    away unknown and forgotten into the ghostly daze of Chinatown
    soup alleyways &amp; firetrucks, not even one free beer,
    who sang out of their windows in despair, fell out of the subway window,
    jumped in the filthy Passaic, leaped on negroes, cried all over the 
    street, danced on broken wineglasses barefoot smashed phonograph
    records of nostalgic European 1930s German jazz finished the whis-
    key and threw up groaning into the bloody toilet, moans in their ears
    and the blast of colossal steamwhistles,
    who barreled down the highways of the past journeying to the each other's
    hotrod-Golgotha jail-solitude watch or Birmingham jazz incarnation,
    who drove crosscountry seventytwo hours to find out if I had a vision or you
    had a vision or he had a vision to find out Eternity,
    who journeyed to Denver, who died in Denver, who came back to Denver
    &amp; waited in vain, who watched over Denver &amp; brooded &amp; loned in
    Denver and finally went away to find out the Time, &amp; now Denver
    is lonesome for her heroes,
    who fell on their knees in hopeless cathedrals praying for each other's salva-
    tion and light and breasts, until the soul illuminated its hair for a 
    second, 
    who crashed through their minds in jail waiting for impossible criminals 
    with golden heads and the charm of reality in their hearts who sang
    sweet blues to Alcatraz,
    who retired to Mexico to cultivate a habit, or Rocky Mount to tender Buddha
    or Tangiers to boys or Southern Pacific to the black locomotive or 
    Harvard to Narcissus to Woodlawn to the daisychain or grave,
    who demanded sanity trials accusing the radio of hypnotism &amp; were left with
    their insanity &amp; their hands &amp; a hung jury,
    who threw potato salad at CCNY lecturers on Dadaism and subsequently
    presented themselves on the granite steps of the madhouse with
    shaven heads and harlequin speech of suicide, demanding instanta-
    neous lobotomy,
    and who were given instead the concrete void of insulin Metrazol electricity
    hydrotherapy psychotherapy occupational therapy pingpong &amp; am-
    nesia,
    who in humorless protest overturned only one symbolic pingpong table,
    resting briefly in catatonia,
    returning years later truly bald except for a wig of blood, and tears and 
    fingers, to the visible madman doom of the wards of the madtowns 
    of the East,
    Pilgrim State's Rockland's and Greystone's foetid halls, bickering with the
    echoes of the soul, rocking and rolling in the midnight solitude-bench
    dolmen-realms of love, dream of life a nightmare, bodies turned to 
    stone as heavy as the moon,
    with mother finally ******, and the last fantastic book flung out of the 
    tenement window, and the last door closed at 4 a.m. and the last 
    telephone slammed at the wall in reply and the last furnished room 
    emptied down to the last piece of mental furniture, a yellow paper
    rose twisted on a wire hanger in the closet, and even that imaginary,
    nothing but a hopeful little bit of hallucination--
    ah, Carl, while you are not safe I am not safe, and now you're really in the
    total animal soup of time--
    and who therefore ran through the icy streets obsessed with a sudden flash 
    of the alchemy of the use of the ellipse the catalog the meter &amp; the
    vibrating plane,
    who dreamt and made incarnate gaps in Time &amp; Space through images
    juxtaposed, and trapped the archangel of the soul between 2 visual
    images and joined the elemental verbs and set the noun and dash of
    consciousness together jumping with sensation of Pater Omnipotens
    Aeterna Deus
    to recreate the syntax and measure of poor human prose and stand before
    you speechless and intelligent and shaking with shame, rejected yet 
    confessing out the soul to conform to the rhythm of thought in his
    naked and endless head,
    the madman bum and angel beat in Time, unknown, yet putting down here
    what might be left to say in time come after death,
    and rose reincarnate in the ghostly clothes of jazz in the goldhorn shadow
    of the band and blew the suffering of America's naked mind for love
    into an eli eli lamma lamma sabacthani saxophone cry that shivered
    the cities down to the last radio
    with the absolute heart of the poem of life butchered out of their own bodies 
    good to eat a thousand years.
    II
    What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up
    their brains and imagination?
    Moloch! Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars! Chil-
    dren screaming under the stairways! Boys sobbing in armies! Old
    men weeping in the parks!
    Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! Mental Mo-
    loch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!
    Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jail-

    1. EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY

    Dawn breaks over the Great Northern.
    CUT TO:

    2. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL ROOM - DAY

    We hear him before we see him, but DALE COOPER is perched six inches above
    the floor in a one-handed yoga "frog" position, wearing boxer shorts and a pair of
    socks, talking into the tape recorder which is sitting on the carpet near his head.

    COOPER
    Diane ... 6:18 a.m., room 315, Great Northern
    Hotel up here in Twin Peaks. Slept pretty well.
    Non-smoking room. No tobacco smell. That's a
    nice consideration for the business traveller. A
    hint of douglas fir needles in the air. As Sheriff
    Truman indicated they would, everything this
    hotel promised, they've delivered: clean,
    reasonably priced accomodations ... telephone
    works ... bathroom in really tip-top shape ... no
    drips, plenty of hot water with good, steady
    pressure ... could be a side-benefit of the
    waterfall just outside my window ... firm
    mattress, but not too firm ... and no lumps like
    that time I told you about down in El Paso ...
    Diane, what a nightmare that was, but of course
    you've heard me tell that story once or twice
    before. Haven't tried the television. Looks like
    cable, probably no reception problems. But the
    true test of any hotel, as you know, is that
    morning cup of coffee, which I'll be getting back
    to you about within the half hour ... Diane, it
    struck me again earlier this morning; there are
    two things that continue to trouble me, and I'm
    not just speaking as an agent of the Bureau but
    also as a human being: what really went on
    between Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedys?
    And who really pulled the trigger on JFK?

    3. EXT. SHERIFF TRUMAN'S HOUSE - MORNING

    A rustic log house, with the Sheriffs cruiser parked in front. A rooster crows.
    SHERIFF TRUMAN exits the house, carrying a soiled paper bag. He walks around
    the side yard to a chicken coop and scatters the feed he has in the bag into the
    coop. They start clucking and pecking.


    TRUMAN
    How you girls doin' this morning? Sounds like
    you got plenty to talk about today. Hope it's
    good news.

    He empties the bag and starts towards the cruiser.

    4. EXT. DOUGHNUT SHOP - DAY

    A sign reads: WAGON-WHEEL DO-NUTS.
    CUT TO:
    5. INT. DOUGHNUT SHOP - MORNING

    A banner reads: GO AHEAD; MAKE MY DONUT. Another banner reads:
    SQUARE DEALS ON ROUND DONUTS.

    DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN and LUCY MORAN are at the counter, in the middle of
    ordering.

    LUCY
    ... two boxes of chocolate creams with jimmies, a
    box of maple bearclaws, one raspberry swizzle
    twist, two boxes of jelly donuts
    (to Andy)
    I'm ordering extra jelly donuts because they're
    Agent Cooper's favorite, you know my aunt I told
    you about with the raccoons? She liked jelly
    donuts, they were her favorite, but she doesn't
    remind me at all of Agent Cooper.
    (a new thought)
    Her son, though, does -

    ANDY
    And one plum frappe turnover.
    CUT TO:
    6. INT. SHERIFF'S CRUISER - MORNING

    Truman drives past Wagon-Wheel Do-Nuts just in time to see Lucy and Andy
    leaving the shop, with Andy carrying a stack of donut boxes up to his neck.

    Truman pulls into the parking lot next to them and leans out the window.

    TRUMAN
    Can I give you three a lift?

    LUCY
    (looking atound)
    But Sheriff, there's only two of us.


    Truman and Andy look at each other.
    CUT TO:

    7. INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL DINING ROOM - DAY

    Dale Cooper sits at a choice corner table, holding a fresh, hot cup of coffee, as a
    WAITRESS stands by, holding the coffee pot.

    COOPER
    (holding up a hand to stop her)
    Wait right there, wait right there ...
    (he sniffs the coffee; hmm ... he sips)
    You know, this is, excuse me, a damn good cup
    of coffee. I've had I can't tell you how many
    cups of coffee I've had in my life and this ...
    (another sip)
    ... this is one of the best.

    WAITRESS
    Thank you.

    COOPER
    I'd like two eggs, over hard, don't tell me, I
    know it's hard on the arteries but old habits die
    hard, just about as hard as I want those eggs ...
    bacon, super crispy, almost burned: cremate it --

    8. AUDREY HORNE

    Across the room, watching Cooper order. She slips into her beguiling, rip-your-
    heart-out routine and sashays across the dining room to Cooper's table.

    COOPER (CONTINUED)
    (just finishing up)
    ... that's great, I'll have the grapefruit juice, as
    long as ...
    (sees Audrey approaching)
    ... those grapefruits are freshly squeezed.

    The Waitress departs. Audrey smiles.

    AUDREY
    My name is Audrey Home.

    COOPER
    Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent
    Dale Cooper.


    AUDREY
    Can I sit here?

    COOPER
    (pleasantly)
    Miss Home, unless I miss my guess, your father is
    Benjamin Home, the owner of this fine
    establishment, so I guess you can sit anywhere
    you like. And I'd also like to add it would be my
    pleasure.

    Audrey sits, a little confused, runs a hand over her forehead.

    AUDREY
    You know, sometimes I get so flushed ... it's
    interesting.

    COOPER
    Were you a friend of Laura Palmer's?

    AUDREY
    Not exactly.

    COOPER
    Her father works for your father. Did you know
    each other growing up?

    AUDREY
    Oh we knew each other ...

    COOPER
    But there was something about her you didn't
    like.

    AUDREY
    Everybody liked Laura. She was just Little Miss
    Perfect. Laura tutored my older brother Johnny
    three times a week. Johnny's twenty-seven and
    he's in the third grade. He's got emotional
    problems; it runs in the family. Do you like my
    ring?
    (holds out her hand to show a big rock))

    COOPER
    Very nice.

    AUDREY
    My father bought it for me. my father was crazy
    about Laura. He bought her a pony when she
    was nine, but he let her father say it was from
    him. Its name was Troy.
    (absent-mindedly rubs her left palm)
    Do your palms ever itch?

    Cooper studies her benignly.

    9. BENJAMIN HORNE

    Crossing the hallway outside the dining room, he glances in and sees his daughter
    sitting with Dale Cooper. He stops, takes this in, then moves on.

    10. EXT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE MORNING

    The trucker, LEO JOHNSON, is obsessively cleaning the cab of his semi rig with a
    dustbuster. A bucket of hot water, some sponges and a hose are at the ready
    nearby. We see that Leo's name is stenciled on the rig's door, along with the
    name, "BIG PUSSYCAT." SHELLY JOHNSON, in her waitress uniform, comes up
    to the truck.

    SHELLY
    Leo, honey? I gotta go to work now, Norma'll be
    here any sec ... Leo?

    Leo turns off the dustbuster and turns to her.

    LEO
    Did you finish cleaning my boots?

    SHELLY
    They're all done and I did the laundry, too.

    LEO
    All of it?

    SHELLY
    Well yeah.

    LEO
    No you didn't.

    He grabs a used grocery bag full of dirty clothes from the cab and flings it at her.

    SHELLY
    Sure, Leo, when I get home I'll -

    LEO
    Now, Shelly.

    SHELLY
    Okay.

    Shelly starts back towards the house.
    CUT TO:

    11. INT. JOHNSON KITCHEN - MORNING

    Shelly dumps the clothes out of the grocery bag onto a laundry basket in front of
    the washer. She shakes out the clothes before putting them in. She stops short
    when she sees a large, dark red bloodstain on a faded blue cowboy work shirt.

    She starts to tremble. She hears a car horn beep outside. She looks out the
    window, sees Norma's car pull in near the truck but she doesn't see Leo.

    She hears the screen door open and bang shut in the other roorn.

    LEO'S VOICE
    Shelly? Norma's here.

    Shelly makes a brave decision: quickly folds the bloodstained shirt and stashes it
    behind the washer, dumps the rest of the clothes in the washer, loads the
    detergent, closes the door and starts it just as Leo comes in the roorn.

    LEO
    Shelly, did you hear me say Norma's here?

    SHELLY
    I heard you, Leo.

    She starts out. He catches her by the arm.

    LEO
    I'm gonna come by the diner sometime today.
    Be a good girl and save me a piece 'a pie.

    He pinches her cheek softly and holds it.

    SHELLY
    (manages a smile)
    Sure, Leo.

    He works her cheek for a moment, squeezing a bit harder. Shelly hides her fear.

    CUT TO:

    12. EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE/INT. NORMA'S CAR - MORNING

    Norma sits behind the wheel of a maroon '64 Falcon station wagon. Shelly gets in
    beside her and they drive off.

    NORMA
    Leo sure keeps that truck up, doesn't he?

    SHELLY
    He sure does.

    NORMA
    (glance at her, sees her condition)
    We're sure a couple a' characters, aren't we
    Shelly?

    SHELLY
    Norma, you said a mouthful and then some.

    NORMA.
