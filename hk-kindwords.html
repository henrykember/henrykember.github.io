          Henry Kember worked with me on one of the most terrifyingly complex projects I’d ever led at Droga. And that’s how I know how good he is. He had a reputation as a writer’s writer and whip smart. When we worked together, I found both those things to be true – along with many other strengths. I was his Group Creative director at the time, and together we were tackling that fateful project, which went on to become very well awarded, earning recognition in categories Droga work rarely gets to enter.
          In that time and in that process, I not only got the chance to experience Henry’s writing skills firsthand. I also came to see how good he is at managing an unwieldy project with lots of arms. 
          Given how effectively Henry managed that crazy experience and how much he contributed, I can happily recommend him as a powerful addition to any creative department.

          Henry is a unique creative. A great writer, with an art director’s eye. He has his finger on the pulse of what’s cool, what’s interesting, what’s insightful, and what will cut through the noise. And that is evident through his eclectic and distinctive body of work. He is also an excellent presenter, and very engaging with clients.

          Henry and I worked together at Droga5, as a team doing the work and mentoring other teams as well. He has a better understanding of the written word than so many writers in our game, and was generous in passing that knowledge on to other writers around him. On Covergirl we got to do some iconic work in a tough, tough category, and much of that was down to Henry's understanding of tone and brand. Plus he's a pleasure to work with, bringing a positive and collaborative energy to every project. I wish we'd been able to work together longer.
